## System Overview

The YOLO People Counter Web Interface is a comprehensive solution for real-time people counting and demographic analysis using computer vision. The system consists of three main components:

1. **Object Detection Models**: Computer vision algorithms running on local devices
2. **Backend API**: Django-based REST API for data management and analytics
3. **Frontend Dashboard**: React-based web interface for data visualization

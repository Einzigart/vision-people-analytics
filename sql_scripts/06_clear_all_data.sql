-- üö® DANGER ZONE - UNCOMMENT TO EXECUTE
-- ========================================

-- Step 1: Clear all detection data (raw records)
-- DELETE FROM api_detectiondata;

-- Step 2: Clear all daily aggregations
-- DELETE FROM api_dailyaggregation;

-- Step 3: Clear all monthly aggregations  
-- DELETE FROM api_monthlyaggregation;

-- Step 4: Reset auto-increment sequences (optional)
-- ALTER SEQUENCE api_detectiondata_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;
-- ALTER SEQUENCE api_dailyaggregation_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;
-- ALTER SEQUENCE api_monthlyaggregation_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;

-- ========================================
-- ALTERNATIVE: SAFER CLEARING OPTIONS
-- ========================================

-- Option A: Clear only detection data (keep aggregations)
-- DELETE FROM api_detectiondata;

-- Option B: Clear data older than 30 days
-- DELETE FROM api_detectiondata WHERE timestamp < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';
-- DELETE FROM api_dailyaggregation WHERE date < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Option C: Clear data for specific year
-- DELETE FROM api_detectiondata WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM timestamp) = 2024;
-- DELETE FROM api_dailyaggregation WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) = 2024;
-- DELETE FROM api_monthlyaggregation WHERE year = 2024;

-- Option D: Clear test data (if you have a pattern)
-- DELETE FROM api_detectiondata WHERE timestamp >= '2025-07-20 00:00:00';

-- üéØ NEXT STEPS AFTER CLEARING
-- ========================================

/*
After clearing the data, you can:

1. üöÄ Generate quick test data:
   - Run: 04_quick_test_data.sql

2. üìÖ Generate today's data:
   - Run: 01_generate_today_data.sql

3. üìä Generate week's data:
   - Run: 02_generate_week_data.sql

4. üéØ Generate custom date range:
   - Run: 05_flexible_date_range_generator.sql
   - Customize the start_date and end_date variables

5. ‚öôÔ∏è Create model settings (if needed):
   INSERT INTO api_modelsettings (id, confidence_threshold_person, confidence_threshold_face, log_interval_seconds, last_updated)
   VALUES (1, 0.5, 0.5, 60, NOW())
   ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

6. üë§ Create admin user (if needed):
   - This should be done through Django admin or management commands
